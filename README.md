# IaC

At this repository, you can see two folders, the first one for Terraform, and the second for Pulumi. The only, and real purpose for this repository is to share my code with the community. 
Be aware, you can't just take this code and run it, I moved all secret values, so you should import yourself values. 

Also, you will see the presentation which I had at Microsoft Community 2019 in Sarajevo. 

Best regrads and see you next year! :D :D :D
